Mass production of millions of unique anime characters is nearly impossible for the best painter, but it is easy using machine learning method! In the guided project, you will have the chance to build machine learning models and produce the anime characters for yourself. After then, you will also handle the machine learning method called Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), which is used for the mass anime production.

## Key learning objectives of this project include:
In the guided project, you will first learn the basic about GANs, using toy data to understand what generator and discriminator is.
In the second half of the guided project, you will train Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) models to create anime characters.
After the guided project, you will be able to:
- know the basic GANs
- implement GANs to datasets
- understand how to train DCGANs 
- produce a large amount of unique photos using DCGANs
- understand how changing the input of the latent space of DCGANs changes the generated image
